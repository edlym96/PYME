There are a few syntactic differences you will learn along the way.\n","\n","### Advantages\n","\n","* General-purpose language, used in web developement as well as high performance computing\n","* It is an \"interpreted\" programming language, i.e. there is no need to compile your code\n","* Extensive choice of libraries to deal with most complicated problems, especially for data science and machine learning\n","* Has extremely steep learning curve, is easy to read and write\n","* Very well documented, and widely used ([docs.python.org](http://docs.python.org) or check Stack Overflow)\n","* Dynamically-typed - it is not necessary to manually define the types of variables (in most cases)\n","\n","### Disadvantages\n","\n","* Dynamically-typed - it is not necessary to manually define the types of variables - this can cause confusion. It is good practice to leave comments with description of the input for every function\n","* Is slower than other compiled languages, this can be rectified by using libraries that are pre-combiled in other programming languages \n","\n","\n","### Plan for today\n","1. Basics: variables, conditional statements, for/while cycles, functions \n","2. Pythonic basics: list comprehension\n","3. Problem solving\n","\n","### How to learn Python?\n","\n","* It is a language, the only way to learn it is to speak it. *Don't be afraid, make mistakes, and ask questions.*\n","* *Practice makes perfect*. Initially you will be forgetting the commands, the more you practice the sooner you will remember the syntax.\n","* If you don't understand something, first compose the question properly, think about it, and if you can't think of a solution ask someone!\n","* Before you execute any cell, stop and try to predict what it will do! Ideally write your prediction on a piece of paper!\n","* Experiment! Change the code in the cells, try various test cases to understand how the code behaves."]},{"metadata":{"colab_type":"text","id":"K5SPq-zSys_j"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# <a class=\"anchor\" name=\"var\"></a>Variables and Data Types"]},{"metadata":{"colab_type":"text","id":"R0uzJ02Mys_o"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Variables are \"black boxes\" used to store values.
